These files come directly from SoundTouch Github (https://github.com/owoudenberg/soundtouch.net/tree/master/src/SoundTouch.Net.NAudioSupport) v2.1.2
They are part of the SoundTouch.Net.NAudioSupport dependency on Nuget, but this dependency uses the version 1.9.0 of NAudio, so it duplicated the versions of the dependency.
Go back to using the nuget dependency once they add support for NAudio v2.0.0.
